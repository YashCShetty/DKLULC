# DKLULC
# Objective:
The project aimed to comprehensively analyze the climate patterns and land cover characteristics of Dakshina Kannada District, Karnataka, India.
# Methodology:
# Climate Analysis:
Conducted an in-depth examination of historical climate data, including temperature and precipitation sourced from local meteorological stations and satellite observations. Utilized statistical methods and geographical information systems (GIS) tools to visualize and interpret the data.
# Land Cover Analysis: 
Employed remote sensing techniques and high-resolution satellite imagery to assess the land cover types within the district. Classified land cover into categories such as forest, agricultural land, urban areas, water bodies, and barren land.
# Integration and Correlation: 
Integrated climate and land cover data to identify correlations and interactions between climate variables and land cover types. Analyzed how land cover changes may influence local climate patterns and vice versa.
# Key Findings:
Climate Trends: Identified long-term climate trends, including changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and the frequency of extreme weather events. Noted any shifts in the onset and duration of seasons. <br>
Land Cover Dynamics: Observed significant changes in land cover over time, such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. Investigated the drivers behind these changes, including human activities and natural processes. <br>
Impact Assessment: Assessed the potential impacts of climate change and land cover modifications on local ecosystems, water resources, agriculture, and human communities. Identified vulnerable areas and suggested adaptation strategies.
